How will AI change the world?
Artificial intelligence has the power to change the way we work, our health, how we consume media and get to work, our privacy, and more. 
Consider the impact that certain AI systems can have on the world as a whole. People can ask a voice assistant on their phones to hail rides from autonomous cars to get them to work, where they can use AI tools to be more efficient than ever before.

Doctors and radiologists could make cancer diagnoses using fewer resources, spot genetic sequences related to diseases, and identify molecules that could lead to more effective medications, potentially saving countless lives.
Alternatively, it's worth considering the disruption that could result from having neural networks that can create realistic images, such as Dall-E 2, Midjourney, and Bing; that can replicate someone's voice or create deepfake videos using a person's resemblance. These could threaten what photos, videos, or audios people can consider genuine.
Another ethical issue with AI concerns facial recognition and surveillance, and how this technology could be an intrusion on people's privacy, with many experts looking to ban it altogether.

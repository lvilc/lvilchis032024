Will an AI steal your job?
The possibility of artificially intelligent systems replacing a considerable chunk of modern labor is a credible near-future possibility.
While commonplace artificial intelligence won't replace all jobs, what seems to be certain is that AI will change the nature of work, with the only question being how rapidly and how profoundly automation will alter the workplace.

However, artificial intelligence can't run on its own, and while many jobs with routine, repetitive data work might be automated, workers in other jobs can use tools like generative AI to become more productive and efficient.
There's a broad range of opinions among AI experts about how quickly artificially intelligent systems will surpass human capabilities.
Fully autonomous self-driving vehicles aren't a reality yet but, by some predictions, the self-driving trucking industry alone is poised to take over 500,000 jobs in the US inevitably, even without considering the impact on couriers and taxi drivers.
